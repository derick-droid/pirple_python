# Think of all the attributes that you could use to describe that song. That is: all of it's details or "meta-data". These are attributes like "Artist", "Year Released", "Genre", "Duration", etc. Think of as many different characteristics as you can.
# Now, within that file, list all of the attributes of the song, one after another, by creating variables for each attribute, and giving each variable a value. Here's an example:
# Give each variable its own line. Then, after you have listed the variables, print each one of them out.
genre = "Bongo Music"
Artist = "Alikiba"
Duration = 3.55
Year_of_release = 2019
song = "Mshumaah"
print(genre)
print(Artist)
print(Duration)
print(Year_of_release)
print(song)
